Implementing 'Attention is all you need'. 
```custom_aug.py``` includes custom augmentations, largely similar to the latest-augmentations but without the heavy DeepAugment augmentations.
```TransformCode.py``` includes the source code for the Transformer.
```transformer_rnn.ipynb``` is the main notebook for training the convolutional LSTM and Transformer.
```validation_acc_videos.ipynb``` is a short notebook to obtain the validation accuracies.
```VideoFrameGenerator.py``` is my custom data generator.
